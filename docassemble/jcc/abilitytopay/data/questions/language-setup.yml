  This is how you pass variables from python-land to javascript-land. You attach
  the value you want to pass to an attribute on a hidden DOM element. We use this
  to render the currently selected language in the language dropdown. See a2p.js.
default screen parts:
  under: |
    <div class="d-none" id="a2p-python-var-lang" data-value="${lang}"></div>
