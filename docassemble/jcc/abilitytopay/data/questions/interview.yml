  * To have a speedy and public trial in front of a judge;
  * To testify, to present evidence, and to use court orders without cost to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence on your behalf;
  * To have the witnesses against you testify under oath in court, and to question such witnesses;
  * To remain silent and not testify and not incriminate yourself.
