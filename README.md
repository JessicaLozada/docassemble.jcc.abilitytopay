# Ability to Pay DocAssemble Interview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JudicialCouncilOfCalifornia/docassemble.jcc.abilitytopay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JudicialCouncilOfCalifornia/docassemble.jcc.abilitytopay)

## Local Development Installation

DocAssemble uses Docker for both local development and deployment. You can find the instructions to setup Docassemble using Docker here:

https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#install
## Configuration

You can also set the following variables to enable exception emails:

    error notification email: <some email>
    error notification variables: True

This will send an email to the address specified when an error occurs.

## A2P API

### Overview

The file `a2papi.py` contains all the logic to connect to the A2P backend. 

The first step is to acquire an OAuth access token - see below for configuration. We issue a request for a token in the `__do_request` method, and use that token for subsequent requests.

Once we have the access token, we use one of the three main methods: 

* `fetch_citation_data`: Citation-number search against `/case/citation` using citation number and county.
* `fetch_case_data`: Runs a case-based search against the `/case/cases` endpoint using first name, last name, county, license number, and DOB.
* `submit_interview`: Submits the a JSON version of the DA interview to the A2P backend using a custom JSON format. This function also persists any uploaded proof documents to the Blob Storage account on Azure (see below for configuration).

### Configuration

The only required configuration is setting up the appropriate A2P API keys in the DocAssemble Configuration tab in the admin dropdown:

    a2p:
      client_id: <client id for backend>
      client_secret: <client secret for backend>
      blob_account_key: <azure storage blob account key>
      blob_account_name: <azure storage blob account name>
      oauth_resource: <resource ID for backend>
      base_url: <API host for making requests to A2P backend>
      ad_url: <ActiveDirectory URL for getting oauth tokens>

To setup email support (so that exception emails will actually send), make sure you have a properly configured SMTP server or provider like SendGrid and follow the steps here: https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#mail

### Debugging

In situations where results are not ideal, you can view the DocAssemble logs (see here for more info): https://docassemble.org/docs/errors.html

Since we are currently pre-launch, we are debugging the entire request and response objects (including URL, body, headers, and response code). This information is present in the logs to ease with the debugging process.

We also wrap each of the three main entrypoint methods mentioned above in a `try... except` block and send an empty response back to DA. This is to avoid having the user see an unhelpful technical error screen. In the logs, however, we log the exception so that we can debug later (the error begins with the text "Error trying to communicate with A2P API").

#### More DocAssemble logs

From https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#troubleshooting:

Log files on the container that you might wish to check include:

- /var/log/supervisor/initialize-stderr---supervisor-*.log (log for the startup process)
- /var/log/supervisor/postgres-stderr---supervisor-*.log (log for the SQL server)
- Other files in /var/log/supervisor/ (logs for other services)
- /var/log/apache2/error.log (log for the web server)
- /usr/share/docassemble/log/docassemble.log (log for the web application)
- /usr/share/docassemble/log/worker.log (log for background processes)
- /var/mail/mail (log for scheduled tasks, generated by cron)
- /tmp/flask.log (log used by Flask in rare situations)


### Infrastructure

The DA Ability to Pay instance currently runs on JCC Azure. The setup instructions are located in `infra/azure_notes.sh`.

Since DA does not maintain tagged Docker releases, we maintain our own fork that we regularly update at `rdeshpande/docassemble`. Update the docker image by running:

    ./rebuild_docker_image.sh

### Deployment

This application is currently deployed to:
- https://mycitations.uat.courts.ca.gov/ for testing
- https://mycitations.courts.ca.gov/ for production

This repository is installed as a package in both deployments. The testing deployment installs from the [uat branch](https://github.com/JudicialCouncilOfCalifornia/docassemble.jcc.abilitytopay/tree/uat), and the production deployment installs from the [prod branch](https://github.com/JudicialCouncilOfCalifornia/docassemble.jcc.abilitytopay/tree/prod).

To update deployed code, push to the corresponding branch, then visit e.g. https://mycitations.uat.courts.ca.gov/updatepackage, scroll down to the docassemble.jcc.abilitytopay package, and click "update".

#### Monitoring

The testing and production deployments are monitored with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). The monitor is configured to look for the words:

```
Request a Fine Reduction
```

on the two courts.ca.gov pages linked above. The monitor sends an e-mail when a service goes up or down.
